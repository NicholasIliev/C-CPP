# Build and Run Script for C Program

This script automates the compilation and execution of a C program consisting of multiple modules. It compiles the source files into object files, links them to create an executable program, and then runs the program. 

## Instructions

1. **Make the Script Executable**

   To make the script executable, open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x build_and_run.sh

2. **Run the script**


    After making the script executable, you can run it with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./build_and_run.sh
